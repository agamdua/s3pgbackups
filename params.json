{"name":"s3pgbackups","tagline":"Amazon S3 PostgreSQL Cluster Backups","body":"### The Basics\r\ns3pgbackups will help you to backup your PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3. It offers convenient ways to exclude certain databases, or tables that you don't want backed up.  It also manages rotating old backups out of the way so that you can keep your storage usage under control.\r\n\r\nSee [the README](https://github.com/gregarmer/s3pgbackups#s3pgbackups) for installation and getting started information.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ s3pgbackups -h\r\nUsage of dist/s3pgbackups:\r\n  -c string  path to the config file (default \"~/.s3pgbackups\")\r\n  -n         don't actually do anything, just print what would be done\r\n  -v         be verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-c config.cfg` is optional. If you don't specify a config it'll default to\r\n`~/.s3pgbackups` and will create this file if it doesn't already exist.\r\n\r\nYou can use the `-n` parameter to put s3pgbackups into no-op mode, where no\r\nactions will actually be performed.\r\n\r\nThe `-v` parameter will make s3pgbackups be verbose about what is actually\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n### The Future\r\nAt some point we'll probably rename the project to something more generic and add support for multiple databases, as well as multiple targets.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* @gregarmer","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
